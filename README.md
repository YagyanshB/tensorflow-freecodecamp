# Tensorflow with Python: 

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Neural Networks have become the next big thing for everyone in their professional careers. However, what exactly is it? 

1. **Artificial Intelligence**: 
The effort to automate intellectual tasks that humans typically perform was initially coined to understand whether computers can think independently.

2. **Machine Learning**: 
This subset of Artificial Intelligence enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

3. **Neural Networks**:
This subset of Machine Learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) method that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain.
